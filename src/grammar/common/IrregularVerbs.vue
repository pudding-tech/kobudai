  In Japanese, most verbs follow regular conjugation patterns as either godan or ichidan verbs, but there are a few irregular verbs that don’t fit neatly into these categories.
  These are exceptions to standard conjugation rules and require special handling.
  Fortunately, there are only two truly irregular verbs in modern Japanese, <span class="g">する</span> (“to do”) and <span class="g">来る</span> (くる, “to come”),
  with a few others that have small irregularities in certain forms.
  <ul>
    <li><span class="g">する</span> (to do): This is one of the most common verbs in Japanese, often used in expressions and compound verbs.</li>
    <li><span class="g"><ruby>来<rt>く</rt></ruby>る</span> (to come): This verb has unique forms across all conjugations.</li>
  </ul>
  See each specific grammar point for more information on how to conjugate these irregular verbs.
