# Kobudai

Kobudai is a grammar resource designed to help users learn Japanese grammar, providing a quick and easy way to look up grammar points. Each point is organized into sorted lists based on popular resources, like the JLPT levels and the Genki textbooks. Additionally, all grammar points are fully searchable for quick access.
